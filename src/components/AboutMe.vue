                years. During this time, I have tutored one-to-one, been a <strong class="italic">SATs marker</strong>

                son who was diagnosed as dyslexic and then later on with dyscalculia. Understanding his difficulties and
                being able to support him became very important to me and this motivated me to want to develop my skills
                further in order to help him and others.</p>
